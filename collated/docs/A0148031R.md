## Introduction

Agendum is a task manager for busy users to manage their schedules and tasks via keyboard commands. It is a Java desktop application that has a **GUI** implemented with JavaFX.

This guide describes the design and implementation of Agendum. It will help developers (like you) understand how Agendum works and how to further contribute to its development. We have organized this guide in a top-down manner so that you can understand the big picture before moving on to the more detailed sections. Each sub-section is mostly self-contained to provide ease of reference.


&nbsp;


## Setting up

### Prerequisites

* **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or above<br>

    > This application will not work with any earlier versions of Java 8.

* **Eclipse** IDE

* **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))

* **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the
   [Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/buildship-gradle-integration)


### Importing the project into Eclipse

1. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer

2. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given in the prerequisites above)

3. Click `File` > `Import`

4. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`

5. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory

6. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish
      (Gradle needs time to download library files from servers during the project set up process)
  > * If Eclipse automatically changed any settings during the import process, you can discard those changes.

    > After you are done importing Agendum, it will be a good practice to enable assertions before developing. This will enable Agendum app to verify assumptions along the way. To enable assertions, follow the instructions [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5509082/eclipse-enable-assertions)

### Troubleshooting project setup

* **Problem: Eclipse reports compile errors after new commits are pulled from Git**
	* Reason: Eclipse fails to recognize new files that appeared due to the Git pull.
	* Solution: Refresh the project in Eclipse:<br>

* **Problem: Eclipse reports some required libraries missing**
	* Reason: Required libraries may not have been downloaded during the project import.
	* Solution: [Run tests using Gardle](UsingGradle.md) once (to refresh the libraries).

### 2. UI component

The `UI` is the entry point of Agendum which is responsible for showing updates to the user; changes in data in the `Model` automatically updates `UI` as well. `UI` executes user commands using the Logic Component. In addition, `UI` responds to events raised from various other parts of Agendum and updates the display accordingly.

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/agendum/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox` and `ResultPopup`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit the abstract `UiPart` class. They can be loaded using `UiPartLoader`.

The `commandBox` component controls the field for user input, and it is associated with a `CommandBoxHistory` object which saves the most recent valid and invalid commands. `CommandBoxHistory` follows a singleton pattern to restrict the instantiation of the class to one object.

Agendum has 3 different task panel classes `UpcomingTasksPanel`, `CompletedTaskPanel` and `FloatingTasksPanel`. They all inherit from the the `TaskPanel` class and hold and load `TaskCard` objects.

The `UI` component uses JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/agendum/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

## Dev Ops

### 1. Build Automation

We use Gradle to run tests and manage library dependencies. The Gradle configuration for this project is defined in _build.gradle_.

### 2. Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our project. When code is pushed to this repository, Travis CI will run the project tests automatically to ensure that existing functionality will not be negatively affected by the changes.

### 3. Making a Release

To contribute a new release:

 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v1.1`
 2. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/)
    and upload the JAR file you created.

### 4. Managing Dependencies

Agendum depends on third-party libraries, such as the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome), for XML parsing, [Natty](http://natty.joestelmach.com) for date & time parsing, [Reflection](https://code.google.com/archive/p/reflections/) for examining classes at runtime and [Google Calendar SDK](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/java/apis/calendar/v3) for sync. Managing these dependencies have been automated using Gradle. Gradle can download the dependencies automatically hence the libraries are not included in this repo and you do not need to download these libraries manually. To add a new dependency, update `build.gradle`.

### Start using Agendum
*This is a brief introduction and suggestion on how to get started with Agendum. Refer to our [Features](#features) section, for a more extensive coverage on what Agendum can do.*

**Step 1 - Get some help**

Feeling lost or clueless? To see a summary of Agendum commands, use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd> to bring up the help screen as shown below. You can start typing a command and press <kbd>ESC</kbd> whenever you want to hide the help screen.

**Step 2 - Add a task**

Perhaps, you can start by adding a task to your empty Agendum to-do list. For example, you might remember you have to return your library books. Type the following line in the command box:

`> add return library books`

Since you did not specify a time to return the books, Agendum will add this task to the **Do It Anytime** panel. The task *return library books* has a ID *1* now.

**Step 3 - Update your task (if needed)**

You might change your mind and want to update the details of the task. For example, you might only want to return a single book "Animal Farm" instead. Type the following line in the command box:

`> rename 1 return "Animal Farm"`

Agendum will promptly update the changes. What if you suddenly discover the book is due within a week? You will want to return "Animal Farm" by Friday night. To (re)schedule the task, type the following command:

`> schedule 1 by friday 8pm`

Since you will have to return your books by a specific time, Agendum will move this task to the **Do It Soon** panel.

**Step 4 - Mark a task as completed**

With the help of Agendum, you remembered to return "Animal Farm" punctually on Friday. Record this by marking the task as completed. Type the following line in the command box:

`> mark 1`

Agendum will move the task _(return "Animal Farm")_ to the **Done** panel.

**Step 5 - Good to go**

Continue exploring Agendum. Add more tasks to your Agendum to-do list and try out the various convenient commands given in the next section. Do note that the ID of the task might change as new tasks are added, updated and marked. Agendum takes care of it for you but you should always refer to the current ID displayed.

**Summary of all the visual changes**

Here is a **summary of all the visual changes** you should see at every step:
<img src="images/userguide/startAgendum.png" width="800"><br>

From Step 4 to 5, the id of the task _return "Animal Farm"_ changed from 1 to 2.

### Searching for tasks : `find`

As your task list grows over time, it may become harder to locate a task.<br>
Fortunately, Agendum can search and bring up these tasks to you (if only you remember some of the keywords): <br>

Here is the *format*:
* `find <keyword>...` - filter out all tasks containing any of the keyword(s) given

  > * The search is not case sensitive. e.g `assignment` will match `Assignment`
  > * The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `2 essay` will match `essay 2`
  > * Only the name is searched
  > * Only full words will be matched e.g. `work` will not match `homework`
  > * Tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). e.g. If I search for `homework assignment`, I will get tasks with names that contains `homework` or `assignment` or both.

Here is an *example*: <br>
 <img src="images/userguide/findResult.png" width="800"><br>

Although you are looking at a narrowed down list of tasks, your data is not lost! Simply hit <kbd>ESC</kbd> to exit your find results and see a list of tasks.


### Listing all tasks : `list`

Alternatively, after you are done searching for tasks, you can use the following command to return to the default view of all your tasks: <br>
The format is simply `list`.

### Viewing help : `help`

At any point in time, if you need some reminder about the commands available, you can use the `help` command. Type `help` or use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd> to summon the help screen. To exit the help screen, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd> again, or simply press <kbd>ESC</kbd>.

Here is a tip: You can directly enter your next command too! Agendum will also exit the help screen and show your task list.
