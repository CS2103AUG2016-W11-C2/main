### Visual Introduction

Here is what Agendum may look like with some tasks added and completed.

<img src="images/userguide/mainui.png" width="800"><br>

Notice how Agendum has 3 panels: **"Do It Soon"**, **"Do It Anytime"** and **"Done"**.
* **"Do It Soon"** panel will show your **uncompleted** tasks with deadlines and events. Those tasks demand your attention at or by some specific time! Agendum has helpfully sorted these tasks by their deadline or event time.
    * **Overdue** tasks _(e.g. tutorial)_ will stand out in red at the top of the list.
    * **Upcoming** tasks (happening/due within a week) _(e.g. essay draft)_ will stand out in light green next.
* **"Do It Anytime"** panel will show your **uncompleted** tasks which you did not specify a deadline or happening time. Do these tasks anytime.
* **"Done"** panel will show all your completed tasks. To make it easier for you to keep track of what you have done recently, Agendum will always show the latest completed tasks at the top of the list.

Agendum will clearly display the name and time associated with each task. Notice that each task is displayed with a ID. For example, the task *learn piano* has a ID *7* now. We will use this ID to refer to the task for some Agendum commands.

The **Command Box** is located at the top of Agendum. Enter your keyboard commands into the box!
Just in case, there is a **Status Bar** located at the bottom of Agendum. You can check today's date and time, where your Agendum's to-do list data is located and when your data was last saved.

Agendum also has a pretty **Help Window** which summarizes the commands you can use. Agendum might show pop-ups and highlights after each commands for you to review your changes.
