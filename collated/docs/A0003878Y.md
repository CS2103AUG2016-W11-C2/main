### 3. Logic component

`Logic` provides several APIs for `UI` to execute the commands entered by the user. It also obtains information about the to-do list to render to the user.
The **API** of the logic component can be found at [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/agendum/logic/Logic.java)

The class diagram of the Logic Component is given below. `LogicManager` implements the `Logic Interface` and has exactly one `Parser`. `Parser` is responsible for processing the user command and creating instances of concrete `Command` objects (such as `AddCommand`) which will then be executed by the `LogicManager`. New command types must implement the `Command` class. Each `Command` class produces exactly one `CommandResult`.

The `CommandLibrary` class is responsible for managing the various Agendum's reserved command keywords and their aliases. The `Parser` checks and queries the `CommandLibrary` to ascertain if a command word given has been aliased to a reserved command word. `AliasCommand` and `UnaliasCommand` will also check and update the `CommandLibrary` to add and remove aliases. The singleton pattern is applied to restrict the instantiation of the class to one object. This is to ensure that all other objects, such as `Parser`, `AliasCommand` and `UnaliasCommand` objects will refer to the same instance that records and manages all the alias relationships.  

You can view the Sequence Diagram below for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.<br>

#### Command Pattern
The Parser creates concrete Command objects such as `AddCommand` objects. `LogicManager` will then execute the various commands, such as `AddCommand` and `UndoCommand`. Each command does a different task and gives a different result. However, as all command types inherit from the abstract class `Command` and implement the _`execute`_ method, LogicManager (the invoker) can treat all of them as Command Object without knowing each specific Command type. By calling the _`execute`_ method, different actions result.

## Getting Started

### Download

1. Ensure that you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or above installed on your computer.
2. Download the latest `Agendum.jar` from [here](../../../releases).<br>
<img src="images/userguide/releases.png" width="300"><br>
3. Copy the jar file to the folder that you intend to use as the root directory of Agendum.

### Launch

To launch Agendum, double-click on `Agendum.jar` to launch Agendum. Welcome!

Here is the main window you will be greeted with. Initially the task panels are empty but fill them up with tasks soon.

## Features

### Commands

**Here are some general things to note:**
> * All command words are case-insensitive. e.g. `Add` will match `add`
> * Words enclosed in angle brackets, e.g.`<name>` are the parameters. You can freely decide what you want to use in its place.
> * Parameters with `...` after them can have multiple instances (separated by whitespace). For example, `<id>...` means that you can specify multiple indices such as `3 5 7`.


### Adding a task: `add`

If you have a task to work on, add it to the Agendum to start keeping track! <br>

Here are the *acceptable format(s)*:

* `add <name>` - adds a task which can be done anytime.
* `add <name> by <deadline>` - adds a task which have to be done by the specified deadline. Note the keyword `by`.
* `add <name> from <start time> to <end time>` - adds a event which will take place between start time and end time. Note the keyword `from` and `to`.

Here are some *examples*:

```
Description: I want to watch Star Wars but I don't have a preferred time.
> add watch Star Wars
Result: Agendum will add a task to the "Do It Anytime" panel.

Description: I need to return my library books by the end of this week.
> add return library books by Friday 8pm
Result: Agendum will add a task "return library books" to the "Do It Soon" panel.
It will have a deadline set to the nearest upcoming Friday and with time 8pm.

Description: I have a wedding dinner which will take place on 30 Oct night.
> add attend wedding dinner from 30 Oct 7pm to 30 Oct 9.30pm
Result: Agendum will add a task "attend wedding dinner" to the "Do It Soon" panel.
It will have a start time 30 Oct 7pm and end time 30 Oct 9.30pm.
```

> A task cannot have both a deadline and a event time.

Did Agendum intepret part of your task name as a deadline/event time when you did not intend for it to do so? Simply `undo` the last command and remember to enclose your task name with **single** quotation mark this time around.
```
> add 'drop by 7 eleven' by tmr
```

#### Date Time Format
How do you specify the `<deadline>`, `<start time>` and `<end time>` of a task?

Agendum supports a wide variety of date time formats. Combine any of the date format and time format below. The date/time formats are case insensitive too.

*Date Format*

| Date Format     | Example(s)           |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Month/day       | 1/23                 |
| Day Month       | 1 Oct                |
| Month Day       | Oct 1                |
| Day of the week | Wed, Wednesday       |
| Relative date   | today, tmr, next wed |

 > If no year is specified, it is always assumed to be the current year.
 > It is possible to specify the year before or after the month-day pair in the first 3 formats (e.g. 1/23/2016 or 2016 1 Oct)
 > The day of the week refers to the following week. For example, today is Sunday (30 Oct). Agendum will interpret Wednesday and Sunday as 2 Nov and 6 Nov respectively (a week from now).

*Time Format*

| Time Format     | Example(s)                              |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Hour            | 10, 22                                  |
| Hour:Minute     | 10:30                                   |
| Hour.Minute     | 10.30                                   |
| Relative time   | this morning, this afternoon, tonight   |

> By default, we use the 24 hour time format but we do support the meridian format as well e.g. 10am, 10pm

Here are some examples of the results if these formats are used in conjunction with the `add` command.  
```
> add submit homework by 9pm
Result: The day is not specified. Agendum will create a task "submit homework"
with the deadline day as today (the date of creation) and time as 9pm

> add use coupons by next Wed
Result: The time is not specified. Agendum will create a task "use coupons"
with deadline day as the upcoming Wednesday and time as the current time.

> add attend wedding dinner from 10 Nov 8pm to 10 Nov 9pm
Result: All the date and time are specified and there is no ambiguity at all.
```

Note
> If no year, date or time is specified, the current year, date or time will be used.
> It is advisable to specify both the date and time.


Helpful tip: With Agendum, you can skip typing the second date only if the deadline/event is **happening some time in the future**
```
> add attend wedding dinner from 30 Nov 8pm to 9pm
```
