### 3. Logic component

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/agendum/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

You can view the Sequence Diagram below for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.<br>

## Features

### Commands

> **Command Format**
> * Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters.
> * Parameters in `SQUARE_BRACKETS` are optional.
> * Parameters with `...` after them can have multiple instances (separated by whitespace).
> * The order of parameters is fixed.
> * Commands and parameters are not case-sensitive e.g `list` will match `List`  


#### Viewing help : `help`

If you need some reminder or more information about the features available, you can use the `help` command.

Format: `help`  
> Help is also shown if an incorrect command is entered e.g. `run`


#### Adding a task: `add`

If you have a task to work on, add it to the Agendum!<br>
You can add a task with no start time or end time by typing the following command

Format: `add TASK_NAME`
> This will create a task without a start date/time or end date/time.

Examples:  

* `add Go to Cold Storage`
* `add Watch Star Wars`
* `add Read The Mythical Man-Month`

You can add a task which must be done by a certain deadline. You can specify the deadline after the keyword `by`.

Format: `add TASK_NAME [by DATE_TIME]`
> Date formats are not case-sensitive

Examples:  

* `add watch Star Wars by Fri`
* `add watch Star Wars by 9pm`
* `add watch Star Wars by next Wed`
* `add watch Star Wars by tonight`
* `add watch Star Wars by 10 Oct, 9.30pm`

If you need a task to be done within a specific date and time, you can specify the start and end time using `from` and `to`.

Format: `add TASK_NAME [from START_DATE_TIME to END_DATE_TIME] `
> If you specify the time but no day or date is given, the date of creation will be used.

Examples:

* `add movie marathon from today 12pm to friday 3pm`
* `add project meeting from 10 oct 12pm to 10 oct 2pm`
* `add clean my room from today 10pm to 12am`

The event â€œproject meetingâ€? will start at 12pm on 10 October and end at 2pm on 10 October.
