### 3. Logic component

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/agendum/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

You can view the Sequence Diagram below for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.<br>

## Quick Start

0. Ensure you have Java version `1.8.0_60` or above installed in your Computer.

   > Take note that Agendum might not work with earlier versions of Java 8.

1. Download the latest `Agendum.jar` from the [releases](../../../releases) tab.

2. Copy Agendum.jar to the folder you want to use as the home.

3. Double-click the file to start Agendum. The GUI should appear promptly.

4. Type a command in the command box and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute it.

   e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> will list some information about commands.

5. Go ahead and try some of the commands listed below!
   * **`add`**` Go to shopping mall` : adds a task with description `Go to shopping mall` to Agendum.
   * **`delete`**` 3` : deletes the 3rd task shown in the current list
   * **`list`** : lists all uncompleted tasks
   * **`exit`** : exits Agendum

6. You can refer to the [Features](#features) section below for more details of each command.


&nbsp;


## Features

> **Command Format**
> * Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters.
> * Parameters in `SQUARE_BRACKETS` are optional.
> * Parameters with `...` after them can have multiple instances (separated by whitespace).
> * The order of parameters is fixed.
> * Commands and parameters are not case-sensitive e.g `list` will match `List`  


#### Viewing help : `help`

If you need some reminder or more information about the features available, you can use the `help` command.

Format: `help`  
> Help is also shown if an incorrect command is entered e.g. `run`


#### Adding a task: `add`

You can add a task without a specific time and date.<br>
Format: `add TASK_NAME`
> This will create a task without a start date/time or end date/time.

Examples:  

* `add Workout`
* `add watch Star Wars`

If you need a task to be done by a specific date, you can specify the deadline after the keyword `by`.<br>
Format: `add TASK_NAME [by DATE_TIME]`
> Date formats are not case-sensitive

Examples:  

* `add watch Star Wars by Fri`
* `add watch Star Wars by 9pm`
* `add watch Star Wars by next Wed`
* `add watch Star Wars by 10 Oct, 9.30pm`

If you need a task to be done within a specific date and time, you can specify the start and end time using `from` and `to`.<br>
Format: `add TASK_NAME [from START_DATE_TIME to END_DATE_TIME] `
> If you specify the time but no day or date is given, the date of creation will be used.

Examples:

* `add movie marathon from today 12pm to friday 3pm`
* `add project meeting from 10 oct 12pm to 10 oct 2pm`

The event â€œproject meetingâ€? will start at 12pm on 10 October and end at 2pm on 10 October.
