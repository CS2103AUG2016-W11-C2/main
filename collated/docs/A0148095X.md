### 5. Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/agendum/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component has the following functions:

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Agendum data in xml format and read it back.

The Object Diagram below shows what it looks like during runtime.

### 6. Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.agendum.commons` package.

They are further separated into sub-packages - namely `core`, `events`, `exceptions` and `util`.

* Core - This package consists of the essential classes that are required by multiple components.
* Events -This package consists of the different type of events that can occur; these are used mainly by EventManager and EventBus.
* Exceptions - This package consists of exceptions that may occur with the use of Agendum.
* Util - This package consists of additional utilities for the different components.

## Testing

You can find all the test files in the `./src/test/java` folder.

### Types of Tests

#### 1. GUI Tests

These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI.
They are in the `guitests` package.

#### 2. Non-GUI Tests

These are tests that do not involve the GUI. They include,
   * _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.agendum.commons.StringUtilTest` tests the correctness of StringUtil methods e.g. if a source string contains a query string, ignoring letter cases.
   * _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units
     (individual code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.agendum.storage.StorageManagerTest` tests if StorageManager is correctly connected to other storage components such as JsonUserPrefsStorage.
   * Hybrids of _unit and integration tests_. These tests are checking multiple code units as well as
      how the are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.agendum.logic.LogicManagerTest` will check various code units from the `Model` and `Logic` components.

#### 3. Headless Mode GUI Tests

Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use,
our GUI tests can be run in [headless mode](#headless-mode). <br>
See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests)  for instructions on how to run tests in headless mode.

### How to Test

#### 1. Using Eclipse

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose to run as a JUnit test.

#### 2. Using Gradle

* Launch a terminal on Mac or command window in Windows. Navigate to Agendumâ€™s project directory. We recommend cleaning the project before running all tests in headless mode with the following command `./gradlew clean headless allTests` on Mac and `gradlew clean headless allTests` on Windows.
* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for more details on how to run tests using Gradle.

>#### Troubleshooting tests
>**Problem: Tests fail because NullPointException when AssertionError is expected**

>* Reason: Assertions are not enabled for JUnit tests.
   This can happen if you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later)
>* Solution: Enable assertions in JUnit tests as described
   [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option). <br>
   Delete run configurations created when you ran tests earlier.

## Introduction
Hi there! Do you have too many tasks and are unable to keep track of all of them? Are you looking for a hassle-free task manager which works swiftly?

Enter Agendum.

This task manager will assist you in completing all your tasks on time. It will automatically sort your tasks by date so you can always see the most urgent tasks standing out at the top of the list! 

With just one line of command, Agendum will carry out your wishes. You donâ€™t ever have to worry about having to click multiple buttons and links. Agendum is even capable of allowing you to create your own custom commands! This means that you can get things done even faster, your way.

As shown below, Agendum has 3 panels: **"Do It Soon"**, **"Do It Anytime"** and **"Done"**. These panels show tasks with time restrictions, tasks without any time restrictions and completed tasks respectively. Initially, the panels will be empty. Fill them up with tasks soon!

#### Creating an alias for a command : `alias`

Perhaps you want to type a command faster, or change the name of a command to suit your needs; <br>
fret not, Agendum allows you to define your own aliases for commands. <br>
You can use both new and old command aliases to carry out the same action.

Format: `alias ORIGINAL_COMMAND_NAME NEW_COMMAND_NAME`  

> * NEW_COMMAND_NAME must be a single word.
> * ORIGINAL_COMMAND_NAME must be a command word that is specified in the Command Summary section
> * When creating an alias for a command with a pre-existing alias, it can also be used to carry out that command.

Examples:

* `alias mark m` <br>
  you can now use`m` or `mark` to mark a task as completed.<br>
  `alias mark mk`<br>
  Now you can use `m`, `mk` or `mark` to mark a task.


#### Removing an alias command : `unalias`

Is a current alias inconvenient? Have you thought of a better one? <br>
Or perhaps you are thinking of using an alias for another command. <br>
To remove a previously defined alias, type:

Format: `unalias ALIAS_FOR_COMMAND_NAME`

> * ALIAS_FOR_COMMAND_NAME must be one of the user-defined command words.
> * Once it has been removed, you can still use the original command word or other unremoved aliases.

Examples:

Assume that mark has been aliased with `m` and `mk`.
* `unalias m`<br>
  `m` can no longer be used to mark tasks; now you can only use the original command `mark` or `mk` to mark a task as completed.

Similarly, you can also use the following command:
* `unalias mk`<br>
  `mk` can no longer be used to mark tasks; now you can only use the original command `mark` to mark a task as completed.


#### Specifying the data storage location : `store`

Are you considering moving Agendumâ€™s data files to another file directory?
You might want to save your Agendum task list to a Cloud Storage service so you can easily access from another device.
Agendum offers you the flexibility in choosing where the task list data will be stored.
The task list data will be saved to the specific directory, and future data will be saved in that location.

Format: `store PATH_TO_FILE`

> * PATH_TO_FILE must be a valid path to a file on the local computer.
> * If a file at PATH_TO_FILE exists, it will be overriden.
> * The previous data storage file will not be deleted.

Examples:
* `store C:/Dropbox/mytasklist.xml`


#### Loading from another data storage location : `load`

After relocating Agendumâ€™s data files, you might want to load that exact copy of Agendumâ€™s task list from a certain location, or from a Cloud Storage service. Agendum also offers you the flexibility to choose which data files to import. 

Format: `load PATH_TO_FILE`

> * PATH_TO_FILE must be a valid path to a file on the local computer.
> * Existing data will be saved and stored in the existing data storage location.
> * The task list in Agendum will be replaced by the loaded task list.
> * Future data will be stored in PATH_TO_FILE.

Examples:
* `load C:/Dropbox/mytasklist.xml`

#### Exiting the program : `exit`

Are you done with organizing your tasks? Well done! <br>
To leave Agendum, type `exit`.

Format: `exit`  


### Keyboard Shortcuts

1. Use the <kbd>UP ARROW</kbd> and <kbd>DOWN ARROW</kbd> to scroll through earlier commands.
2. If you are entering a new command, use the <kbd>DOWN ARROW</kbd> to instantly clear the command line.


### Saving the data

Agendum saves its data into the specified data storage location, or by default it saves into `todolist.xml`. This saving automatically happens whenever the task list is changed; There is no need to save manually.

## FAQ

<html>
<dl>
   <dt> Q: How do I transfer my data to another computer? </dt>
   <dd> Firstly, take note of the data storage location that your current todo list is saved at. You can check this by looking at the            bottom-right of Agendum. Navigate to this location and copy the data file to a portable USB device or hard disk. Then, ensure            that you have installed Agendum in the other computer. Copy the data file from your device onto the other computer, preferrably          in the same folder as Agendum. Use the <code>load</code> command to load it into Agendum. </dd>

   <dt> Q: Why did Agendum complain about an invalid file directory? </dt>
   <dd> Check if the directory you wish to relocate to exists, or if you have enough administrator privileges. </dd>

   <dt> Q: Can Agendum remind me when my task is due soon? </dt>
   <dd> Agendum will always show the tasks that are due soon at the top of list. However, Agendum will not show you a reminder. </dd>
   
   <dt> Q: Why did Agendum reject my alias for a command? </dt>
   <dd> The short-hand command cannot be one of Agendumâ€™s command keywords (e.g. add, delete) and cannot be concurrently used to alias            another command (e.g. m cannot be used for both mark and unmark). </dd>
