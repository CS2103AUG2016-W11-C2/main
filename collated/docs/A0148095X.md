### 5. Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/agendum/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component has the following functions:

* saves `UserPref` objects in json format and reads it back.
* saves the Agendum data in xml format and reads it back.

Other components such as `Model` require the functionalities defined inside the `Storage` component in order to save task data and user preferences to the hard disk. The `Storage` component uses the *Facade* design pattern. Components such as `ModelManager` access storage sub-components through `StorageManager` which will then redirect method calls to its internal component such as `JsonUserPrefsStorage` and `XmlToDoListStorage`. `Storage` also shields the internal details of its components, such as the implementation of `XmlToDoListStorage`, from external classes.

The Object Diagram below shows what it looks like during runtime.

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the storage class will interact with model when `Load` command is executed.

### 6. Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.agendum.commons` package.

They are further separated into sub-packages - namely `core`, `events`, `exceptions` and `util`.

* Core - This package consists of the essential classes that are required by multiple components.
* Events -This package consists of the different type of events that can occur; these are used mainly by EventManager and EventBus.
* Exceptions - This package consists of exceptions that may occur with the use of Agendum.
* Util - This package consists of additional utilities for the different components.

## Testing

You can find all the test files in the `./src/test/java` folder.

### Types of Tests

#### 1. GUI Tests

These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI.
They are in the `guitests` package.

#### 2. Non-GUI Tests

These are tests that do not involve the GUI. They include,
   * _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.agendum.commons.StringUtilTest` tests the correctness of StringUtil methods e.g. if a source string contains a query string, ignoring letter cases.
   * _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units
     (individual code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.agendum.storage.StorageManagerTest` tests if StorageManager is correctly connected to other storage components such as JsonUserPrefsStorage.
   * Hybrids of _unit and integration tests_. These tests are checking multiple code units as well as
      how the are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.agendum.logic.LogicManagerTest` will check various code units from the `Model` and `Logic` components.

#### 3. Headless Mode GUI Tests

Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use,
our GUI tests can be run in [headless mode](#headless-mode). <br>
See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests)  for instructions on how to run tests in headless mode.

### How to Test

#### 1. Using Eclipse

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose to run as a JUnit test.

#### 2. Using Gradle

* Launch a terminal on Mac or command window in Windows. Navigate to Agendum’s project directory. We recommend cleaning the project before running all tests in headless mode with the following command `./gradlew clean headless allTests` on Mac and `gradlew clean headless allTests` on Windows.
* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for more details on how to run tests using Gradle.

>#### Troubleshooting tests
>**Problem: Tests fail because NullPointException when AssertionError is expected**

>* Reason: Assertions are not enabled for JUnit tests.
   This can happen if you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later)
>* Solution: Enable assertions in JUnit tests as described
   [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option). <br>
   Delete run configurations created when you ran tests earlier.

## Introduction
Hi there! Do you have too many tasks to do? Are you unable to keep track of all of them? Are you looking for a hassle-free task manager which will work swiftly?

Enter Agendum.

This task manager will assist you in completing all your tasks on time. It will automatically sort your tasks by date so you can always see the most urgent tasks at the top of the list!

Agendum is simple, flexible and phenomenally keyboard friendly. With just one line of command, Agendum will carry out your wishes. You don’t ever have to worry about having to click multiple buttons and links. Agendum is even capable of supporting your own custom command words! This means that you can get things done even faster, your way.

### Creating an alias for a command : `alias`

Perhaps you want to type a command faster, or change the name of a command to suit your needs; <br>
fret not, Agendum allows you to define your own aliases for commands. <br>
You can use both the original command and your own shorthand alias to carry out the same action.

To create an alias, here is the *format*:
* `alias <original command> <your command>`

> * `<your command>` must be a single alphanumeric word. It cannot be a original-command or already aliased to another command.
> * `<original command>` must be a command word that is specified in the Command Summary section

Examples:
```
> alias mark m
Result: you can now use `m` or `mark` to mark a task as completed.
> alias mark mk
Result: Now you can use "m", "mk" or "mark" to mark a task as completed.
```


### Removing an alias command : `unalias`

Is a current alias inconvenient? Have you thought of a better one? <br>
Or perhaps you are thinking of using an alias for another command instead. <br>

To remove a previously defined alias, here is the *format*:
* `unalias <your command>`

> * `<your command>` should be an alias you previously defined.
> * After removing this particular alias, you can still use the original command word or other unremoved aliases.

Examples:
```
If mark is aliased with "m" and "mk".
> unalias mk
Result: "mk" can no longer be used to mark tasks; now you can only use the
original command "mark" or "m" to mark a task as completed.
```

### Specifying the data storage location : `store`

Are you considering moving Agendum’s data files to another file directory?
You might want to save your Agendum task list to a Cloud Storage service so you can easily access from another device.
Agendum offers you the flexibility in choosing where the task list data will be stored.
The task list data will be saved to the specific directory and future data will be saved in that location.

Here is the *format*:
* `store <location>`

> * `<location>` must be a valid path to a file on the local computer.
> * If there is an existing file at `<location>`, it will be overriden.
> * The data storage file at the original location will not be deleted.
> * This command is similar to a "Save as..." in other applications.

Examples:
```
> store C:/Dropbox/mytasklist.xml
```


### Loading from another data storage location : `load`

After relocating Agendum’s data files, you might want to load that exact copy of Agendum’s task list from a certain location, or from a Cloud Storage service. Agendum also offers you the flexibility to choose which data files to import.

Here is the *format*:
* `load <location>`

> * `<location>` must be a valid path to a file on the local computer.
> * Your current data would have already been saved automatically in its original data storage location.
> * Agendum will then show data loaded from `<location>` and save data there in the future.
> * You will not be able to `undo` immediately after loading as there have been no changes to the loaded list.

Examples
```
> load C:/Dropbox/mytasklist.xml
```

### Synchronizing with Google calendar: `sync`

If you have a Google account and want to synchronize your tasks from Agendum to Google Calendar, this command enables you to do exactly that! Synchronization takes place when you turn it on.

Here is the *format*:
* `sync ON` or `sync OFF`

> * `sync` must have either ON or OFF after the command word
> * Only data from Agendum will be synchronized to Google Calendar
> * Only tasks with a start and end date/time will be synchronized
> * Please accept or decline Google's request for permission for Agendum client to manage your calendar. Do not close the window abruptly.


### Exiting Agendum : `exit`

Are you done with organizing your tasks? Well done! <br>
To leave Agendum, type `exit`. See you soon!


### Keyboard Shortcuts

To work even faster you can also use keyboard shortcuts: <br>
1. Use <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> to scroll through previously typed commands. You don't need to remember or enter them again! <br>
2. If you are entering a new command, use <kbd>↓</kbd> to instantly clear the command line and start afresh. <br>
3. Use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to quickly auto-complete a command word when you are typing. <br>
4. Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd> to conveniently switch between the help window and the command box. Also, you can use <kbd>ESC</kbd> to close help window. <br>
5. Use  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> in place of `undo`

## FAQ

<html>
<dl>
   <dt> Q: How do I save my task data in Agendum? </dt>
   <dd> Agendum saves your data automatically whenever your task list is updated. There is no need to save manually. Agendum will save the data at the speicified storage location. By default, it will save to `data/todolist.xml` </dd>

   <dt> Q: How do I transfer my data to another computer? </dt>
   <dd> Firstly, note down the current save location of Agendum's task data (which is displayed in the bottom status bar). In your file directory, navigate to this location and copy the data file to a portable USB device, hard disk or your cloud storage folder. Alternatively, you can make use of the <code>store</code> command to transfer the file within Agendum. Then, ensure that you have installed Agendum in the other computer. Copy the data file from your device onto the other computer, preferrably in the same folder as Agendum. Use the <code>load</code> command to load it into Agendum. </dd>

   <dt> Q: Why did Agendum complain about an invalid file directory? </dt>
   <dd> Check if the directory you wish to relocate to exists and if you have enough administrator privileges. </dd>

   <dt> Q: Can Agendum remind me when my task is due soon? </dt>
   <dd> Agendum will always show the tasks that are due soon at the top of list. However, Agendum will not show you a reminder (yet). </dd>

   <dt> Q: Why did Agendum complain that the task already exists? </dt>
   <dd> You have previously created a task with the same name, start and end time. The tasks have the same completion status too! Save the trouble of creating one or it will be helpful to distinguish them by renaming instead.

   <dt> Q: Why did Agendum reject my alias for a command? </dt>
   <dd> The short-hand command cannot be one of Agendum’s command keywords (e.g. add, delete) and cannot be concurrently used to alias            another command (e.g. m cannot be used for both mark and unmark). </dd>

   <dt> Q: I can't launch Agendum. What is wrong? </dt>
   <dd> Check if the config file in data/json/config.json contains the correct file paths to other data such as your to-do list. It might be helpful to delete the user preferences file. </dd>
