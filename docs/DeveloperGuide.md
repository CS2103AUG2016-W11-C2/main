## Introduction

Agendum is a task manager for busy users to manage their schedules and tasks via keyboard commands. It is a Java desktop application that has a **GUI** implemented with JavaFX.

This guide describes the design and implementation of Agendum. It will help developers (like you) understand how Agendum works and how to further contribute to its development. We have organized this guide in a top-down manner so that you can understand the big picture before moving on to the more detailed sections. Each sub-section is mostly self-contained to provide ease of reference.


&nbsp;


## Setting up

### Prerequisites

* **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or above<br>

    > This application will not work with any earlier versions of Java 8.

* **Eclipse** IDE

* **e(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))

* **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the
   [Eclipse Marketplace](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/buildship-gradle-integration)


### Importing the project into Eclipse

1. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer

2. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given in the prerequisites above)

3. Click `File` > `Import`

4. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`

5. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory

6. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' config files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish
      (Gradle needs time to download library files from servers during the project set up process)
  > * If Eclipse automatically changed any settings during the import process, you can discard those changes.

    > After you are done importing Agendum, it will be a good practice to enable assertions before developing. This will enable Agendum app to verify assumptions along the way. To enable assertions, follow the instructions [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5509082/eclipse-enable-assertions)

### Troubleshooting project setup

* **Problem: Eclipse reports compile errors after new commits are pulled from Git**
	* Reason: Eclipse fails to recognize new files that appeared due to the Git pull.
	* Solution: Refresh the project in Eclipse:<br>

* **Problem: Eclipse reports some required libraries missing**
	* Reason: Required libraries may not have been downloaded during the project import.
	* Solution: [Run tests using Gardle](UsingGradle.md) once (to refresh the libraries).

## Design


[comment]: # (@@author A0133367E)
### 1. Architecture

<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="600"><br>

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above summarizes the high-level design of Agendum.
Here is a quick overview of the main components of Agendum and their main responsibilities.

#### `Main`
The **`Main`** component has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/agendum/MainApp.java). It is responsible for initializing all components in the correct sequence and connecting them up with each other at app launch. It is also responsible for shutting down the other components and invoking the necessary clean up methods when Agendum is shut down.


#### `Commons`
[**`Commons`**](#6-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two such classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCentre` : This class (written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))
  is used by components to communicate with other components using events.
* `LogsCenter` : This class is used by many classes to write log messages to Agendum's log file to record noteworthy system information and events.


#### `UI`
The [**`UI`**](#2-ui-component) component is responsible for interacting with the user by accepting commands, displaying data and results such as updates to the task list.


#### `Logic`
The [**`Logic`**](#3-logic-component) component is responsible for processing and executing the user's commands.


#### `Model`
The [**`Model`**](#4-model-component) component is responsible for representing and holding Agendum's data.


#### `Storage`
The [**`Storage`**](#5-storage-component) component is responsible for reading data from and writing data to the hard disk.


Each of the `UI`, `Logic`, `Model` and `Storage` components:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java`
interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.<br>
<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>


#### Event Driven Approach
Agendum applies an Event-Driven approach and the **Observer Pattern** to reduce direct coupling between the various components. For example, in Agendum, the `UI` and `Storage` components are interested in receiving notifications when there is a change in the to-do list in `Model`. To avoid bidrectional coupling, `Model` does not inform these components of changes directly. Instead, it posts event and depend on the `EventsCenter` to notifying the register Observers in `Storage` and `UI`.

For example, consider the scenario where the user inputs `delete 1` described in the _Sequence Diagram_ below. The `UI` component will invoke the `Logic` component’s  _execute_ method to carry out the given command, `delete 1`. The `Logic` component will identify the corresponding task and will call the `Model` component _deleteTasks_ method to update Agendum’s data and raise a `ToDoListChangedEvent`.

<img src="images\SDforDeleteTask.png" width="800">

The diagram below shows what happens after a `ToDoListChangedEvent` is raised. `EventsCenter` will inform the subscribers (the `UI` and `Storage` components). `Storage` will respond and save the changes to hard disk while `UI` will respond and update the status bar to reflect the 'Last Updated' time. <br>

<img src="images\SDforDeleteTaskEventHandling.png" width="800">

#### Model-View-Controller approach
To further reduce coupling between components, the Model-View-Controller pattern is also applied. The 3 components are as follows:
* Model: The `Model` component as previously described, maintains and holds Agendum's data.
* View: Part of the `UI` components and resources such as the .fxml file is responsible for displaying Agendum's data and interacting with the user. Through events, the `UI` component is able to get data updates from the model.
* Controller: Parts of the `UI` component such as (`CommandBox`) act as 'Controllers' for part of the UI. The `CommandBox` accepts user command input and request `Logic` to execute the command entered. This execution may result in changes in the model.


#### Activity Diagram

<img src="images\activityDiagram.jpg" width="800"> <br>

The Activity Diagram above illustrates Agendum's workflow. Brown boxes represent actions taken by Agendum while orange boxes represent actions that involve interaction with the user.  

After Agendum is launched, Agendum will wait for the user to enter a command. Every command is parsed. If the command is valid and adheres to the given format, Agendum will executes the command. Agendum `Logic` component checks the input such as indices before updating the model and storage if needed.  

Agendum will then display changes in the to-do list and feedback of each command in the UI. The user can then enter a command again. Agendum will also give pop-up feedbacks when the command format or inputs are invalid.

The following sections will then give more details of each individual component.

### 2. UI component

The `UI` is the entry point of Agendum which is responsible for showing updates to the user; changes in data in the `Model` automatically updates `UI` as well. `UI` executes user commands using the Logic Component. In addition, `UI` responds to events raised from various other parts of Agendum and updates the display accordingly.

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/agendum/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox` and `ResultPopup`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit the abstract `UiPart` class. They can be loaded using `UiPartLoader`.

The `commandBox` component controls the field for user input, and it is associated with a `CommandBoxHistory` object which saves the most recent valid or invalid commands. `CommandBoxHistory` follows a singleton pattern to restrict the instantiation of the class to one object.

Agendum has 3 different task panel classes `UpcomingTasksPanel`, `CompletedTaskPanel` and `FloatingTasksPanel`. They all inherit from the the `TaskPanel` class and hold and load `TaskCard` objects.

The `UI` component uses JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/agendum/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)


[comment]: # (@@author A0003878Y)
### 3. Logic component

`Logic` provides several APIs for `UI` to execute the commands entered by the user. It also obtains information about the to-do list to render to the user.
The **API** of the logic component can be found at [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/agendum/logic/Logic.java)

The class diagram of the Logic Component is given below. `LogicManager` implements the `Logic Interface` and has exactly one `Parser`. `Parser` is responsible for processing the user command and creating instances of concrete `Command` objects (such as `AddCommand`) which will then be executed by the `LogicManager`. New command types must implement the `Command` class. Each `Command` class produces exactly one `CommandResult`.

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

The `CommandLibrary` class is responsible for managing the various Agendum's reserved command keywords and their aliases. The `Parser` checks and queries the `CommandLibrary` to ascertain if a command word given has been aliased to a reserved command word. `AliasCommand` and `UnaliasCommand` will also check and update the `CommandLibrary` to add and remove aliases. The singleton pattern is applied to restrict the instantiation of the class to one object. This is to ensure that all other objects, such as Parser, AliasCommand and UnaliasCommand objects will refer to the same instance that records all the alias relationships.

You can view the Sequence Diagram below for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.<br>

<img src="images/DeleteTaskSdForLogic.png" width="800"><br>

#### Command Pattern
The Parser creates concrete Command objects such as `AddCommand` objects. `LogicManager` will then execute the various commands, such as `AddCommand` and `UndoCommand`. Each command does a different task and gives a different result. However, as all command types inherit from the abstract class `Command` and implement the _`execute`_ method, LogicManager (the invoker) can treat all of them as Command Object without knowing each specific Command type. By calling the _`execute`_ method, different actions result.

### 4. Model component

As mentioned above, the `Model` component stores and manages Agendum's task list data and user's preferences. It also exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' by other components e.g. the `UI` can be bound to this list and will automatically update when the data in the list change.

Due to the application of the **Observer Pattern**, it does not depend on other components such as `Storage` but interact by raising events instead.

The `Model` class is the interface of the `Model` component. It provides several APIs for the `Logic` and `UI` components to update and retrieve Agendum’s task list data. The **API** of the model component can be found at [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/agendum/model/Model.java).  

The structure and relationship of the various classes in the `Model` component is described in the diagram below.    

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

`ModelManager` implements the `Model` Interface. It contains a `UserPref` Object which represents the user’s preference and a `SyncManager` object which is necessary for the integration with Google calendar.

`ModelManager` contains a **main** `ToDoList` object and a stack of `ToDoList` objects referred to as `previousLists`. The **main** `ToDoList` object is the copy that is indirectly referred to by the `UI` and `Storage`. The stack, `previousLists` is used to support the [`undo` operation](#### undo).

Each `ToDoList` object has one `UniqueTaskList` object. A `UniqueTaskList` can contain multiple `Task` objects but does not allow duplicates.  

The `ReadOnlyToDoList` and `ReadOnlyTask` interfaces allow other classes and components, such as the `UI`, to access but not modify the list of tasks and their details.  

Currently, each `Task` has a compulsory `Name` and last updated time. It is optional for a `Task` to have a start and end time. Each `Task` also has a completion status which is represented by a boolean.

Design considerations:
> * `ToDoList` is a distinct class from `UniqueTaskList` as it can potentially be extended to have another `UniqueTagList` object to keep track of tags associated with each task and `ToDoList` will be responsible for syncing the tasks and tags.
> * `Name` is a separate class as it might be modified to have its own validation regex e.g. no / or "

Using the same example, if the `Logic` component requests `Model` to _deleteTasks(task)_, the subsequent interactions between objects can be described by the following sequence diagram.  

<img src="images\SDforDeleteTaskModelComponent.png" width="800">

The identified task is removed from the `UniqueTaskList`. The `ModelManager` raises a `ToDoListChangedEvent` and back up the current to do list to `previousLists`

> `Model`’s _deleteTasks_ methods actually take in `ArrayList<ReadOnlyTask>` instead of a single task. We use _deleteTasks(task)_ for simplicity in the sequence diagram.

#### undo

`previousLists` is a Stack of `ToDoList` objects with a minimum size of 1. The `ToDoList` object at the top of the stack is identical to the **main** `ToDoList` object before any operation that mutate the to-do list is performed and after any operation that mutates the task list successfully (without exceptions).

This is achieved with the _backupCurrentToDoList_ function which pushes a copy of the **main** `ToDoList` to the stack after any successful changes, such as the marking of multiple tasks.

To undo the most recent changes, we simply pop the irrelevant `ToDoList` at the top of the `previousLists` stack and copy the `ToDoList` at the top of the stack back to the **main** list 

This approach eliminates the need to implement an "undo" method and store the changes separately for each command that will mutate the task list.

Also, it helps to resolve the complications involved with manipulating multiple task objects at a go. For example, the user might try to mark multiple tasks and one of which will result in a `DuplicateTaskException`. To revert the undesired changes to the **main** `ToDoList`, we can copy the the `ToDoList` at the top of the stack back to the **main** list. In such unsuccessful operations, the changes would not have persisted to Storage.

### 5. Storage component

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/agendum/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component has the following functions:

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Agendum data in xml format and read it back.

Other components such as `Model` require the functionalities defined inside the `Storage` component in order to save task data and user preferences to the hard disk. The `Storage` component uses the *Facade* design pattern. Components such as `ModelManager` access storage sub-components through `StorageManager` which will then redirect method calls to its internal component such as `JsonUserPrefsStorage` and `XmlToDoListStorage`. `Storage` also shields the internal details of the Storage and its related components, such as the implementation of `XmlToDoListStorage`, from external classes.

The Object Diagram below shows what it looks like during runtime.

<img src="images/StorageManagerObjectDiagram.png" width="400"><br>

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the storage class will interact with model when `Load` command is executed.

<img src="images/SDforLoad.png" width="700"><br>


### 6. Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.agendum.commons` package.

They are further separated into sub-packages - namely `core`, `events`, `exceptions` and `util`.

* Core - This package consists of the essential classes that are required by multiple components.
* Events -This package consists of the different type of events that can occur; these are used mainly by EventManager and EventBus.
* Exceptions - This package consists of exceptions that may occur with the use of Agendum.
* Util - This package consists of additional utilities for the different components.

## Implementation

### 1. Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#2-configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

Currently, Agendum has 4 logging levels: `SEVERE`, `WARNING`, `INFO` and `FINE`. They record information pertaining to:

* `SEVERE` : A critical problem which may cause the termination of Agendum<br>
   e.g. fatal error during the initialization of Agendum's main window
* `WARNING` : A problem which requires attention and caution but allows Agendum to continue working<br>
   e.g. error reading from/saving to config file
* `INFO` : Noteworthy actions by Agendum<br>
  e.g. valid and invalid commands executed and their results
* `FINE` : Less significant details that may be useful in debugging<br>
  e.g. all fine details of the tasks including their last updated time

### 2. Configuration

You can alter certain properties of our Agendum application (e.g. logging level) through the configuration file.
(default:`config.json`).


&nbsp;


[comment]: # (@@author A0148095X)
## Testing

You can find all the test files in the `./src/test/java` folder.

### Types of Tests

#### 1. GUI Tests

These are _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI.
They are in the `guitests` package.

#### 2. Non-GUI Tests

These are tests that do not involve the GUI. They include,
   * _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.agendum.commons.StringUtilTest` tests the correctness of StringUtil methods e.g. if a source string contains a query string, ignoring letter cases.
   * _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units
     (individual code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.agendum.storage.StorageManagerTest` tests if StorageManager is correctly connected to other storage components such as JsonUserPrefsStorage.
   * Hybrids of _unit and integration tests_. These tests are checking multiple code units as well as
      how the are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.agendum.logic.LogicManagerTest` will check various code units from the `Model` and `Logic` components.

#### 3. Headless Mode GUI Tests

Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use,
our GUI tests can be run in [headless mode](#headless-mode). <br>
See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests)  for instructions on how to run tests in headless mode.

### How to Test

#### 1. Using Eclipse

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose to run as a JUnit test.

#### 2. Using Gradle

* Launch a terminal on Mac or command window in Windows. Navigate to Agendum’s project directory. We recommend cleaning the project before running all tests in headless mode with the following command `./gradlew clean headless allTests` on Mac and `gradlew clean headless allTests` on Windows.
* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for more details on how to run tests using Gradle.

>#### Troubleshooting tests
>**Problem: Tests fail because NullPointException when AssertionError is expected**

>* Reason: Assertions are not enabled for JUnit tests.
   This can happen if you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later)
>* Solution: Enable assertions in JUnit tests as described
   [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option). <br>
   Delete run configurations created when you ran tests earlier.

## Dev Ops

### 1. Build Automation

We use Gradle to run tests and manage library dependencies. The Gradle configuration for this project is defined in _build.gradle_.

### 2. Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our project. When code is pushed to this repository, Travis CI will run the project tests automatically to ensure that existing functionality will not be negatively affected by the changes.

### 3. Making a Release

To contribute a new release:

 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v1.1`
 2. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/)
    and upload the JAR file you created.

### 4. Managing Dependencies

Agendum depends on third-party libraries, such as the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these dependencies have been automated using Gradle. Gradle can download the dependencies automatically hence the libraries are not included in this repo and you do not need to download these libraries manually. To add a new dependency, update _build.gradle_.

## Appendix E : Product Survey

We conducted a product survey on other task managers. Here is a summary of the strengths and weaknesses of each application. The criteria used for evaluation are own preferences and Jim's requirements.

#### Main insights
* Keyboard friendliness of our application is extremely important. It is useful to distinguish our application from the rest. Keyboard shortcuts must be intuitive, easy to learn and remember.
    * Tab for autocomplete
    * Scroll through command history or task list with up and down
    * Allow users to specify their own shorthand commands so they will remember
    * Summoning the help window with a keyboard shortcut
* Clear visual feedback on the status of the task
    * Overdue and upcoming tasks should stand out
    * Should also be able to see if a task is completed or recurring
    * Identify if the task is selected/has just been updated
* Organized overview of all tasks
    * Tasks should be sorted by their deadline/happening time
    * Users might like to see their recently updated/completed tasks at the top of the list
    * Allow user to see these various types of tasks and distinguish them without having to switch between lists (i.e. have multiple lists)
* Will be nice to allow more details for tasks
    * detailed task descriptions
    * tagging
* Commands should be intuitive and simple enough for new users
    * more natural language like parsing for dates with prepositions as keywords


#### Wunderlist

*Strengths:*

* Clearly displays tasks that have not been completed
* Tasks can be categorized under different lists
* Tasks can have sub tasks
* Possible to highlight tasks by marking as important (starred) or pinning tasks
* Can set deadlines for tasks
* Can create recurring tasks
* Can associate files with tasks
* Can be used offline
* Keyboard friendly – keyboard shortcuts to mark tasks as completed and important
* Search and sort functionality makes finding and organizing tasks easier
* Possible to synchronize across devices
* Give notifications and reminders for tasks near deadline or overdue

*Weaknesses:*

* Wunderlist has a complex interface and might require multiple clicks to get specific tasks done. For example, it has separate field to add tasks, search for tasks and a sort button. There are various lists & sub-lists. Each list has a completed/uncompleted  section and each task needs to be clicked to display the associated subtasks, notes, files and comment.
* New users might not know how to use the advanced features e.g. creating recurring tasks

#### Google calendar

*Strengths:*

* Have a weekly/monthly/daily calendar view which will make it easy for users to visualize their schedules
* Can create recurring events
* Integrated with Gmail. A user can add events from emails easily and this is desirable since Jim's to do items arrive by emails
* Can be used offline
* Possible to synchronize across devices
* Calendar can be exported to CSV/iCal for other users
* CLI to quick add an event to a calendar instead of clicking through the screen
* Comprehensive search by name/details/people involved/location/time


*Weaknesses:*

* Not possible to mark tasks as completed
* Not possible to add tasks without deadline or time
* CLI does not support updating of tasks/deleting etc. Still requires clicking.
* New users might not know of the keyboard shortcuts
