  `alias mark mk`

#### Remove an alias command : `unalias`

If you no longer want to use the alternative alias command, you can remove it.
Format: `unalias NEW_COMMAND_NAME` or `unalias ORIGINAL_COMMAND_NAME`

  `m` can no longer be used to mark tasks.
  `unalias mark`
  The assigned alias for `mark` will be removed, and only `mark` can be used to mark a task as completed.
